  <h3>What's this about?</h3>
  <p>
    This Django application is an example I created to illustrate a <a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/18/how-to-implement-multiple-user-types-with-django.html">blog post about how to implement multiple user types</a>.
    In this application, users can sign up as a student or a teacher. Teachers can create quizzes and students can answer quizzes
    based on their interests.
